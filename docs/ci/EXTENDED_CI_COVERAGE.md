## CI Scripts Added

### 1. Comprehensive Test Runner (`scripts/ci/comprehensive-test-runner.js`)

Runs all test types across all modules:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Coverage reporting

**Usage:**
```bash
pnpm ci:comprehensive
```

### 2. Coverage Report Generator (`scripts/ci/ci-coverage-report.js`)

Generates detailed coverage reports:
- Module-by-module coverage analysis
- Missing test identification
- Coverage recommendations
- Overall coverage metrics

**Usage:**
```bash
pnpm ci:coverage
```

### 3. Security and Quality Checker (`scripts/ci/security-quality-check.js`)

Performs comprehensive security and quality checks:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Hardcoded secret detection
- Input validation verification
- SQL injection protection checks
- Code complexity analysis
- File size monitoring
- Naming convention validation
- Documentation coverage
- Error handling assessment

**Usage:**
```bash
pnpm ci:security
```

## Updated CI Pipeline

The GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`infra/ci/ci.yml`) now includes:

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Runs all test types
   - Generates coverage reports
   - Validates test results

2. **Security and Quality Checks**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Code quality analysis
   - Security best practices validation

3. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Detailed coverage reporting
   - Missing test identification
   - Coverage threshold enforcement

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Payment performance smoke tests
   - Quote performance smoke tests
   - API response time validation

## New Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "test:coverage": "pnpm --recursive test:coverage",
  "test:ci": "pnpm --recursive test:ci",
  "ci:coverage": "node scripts/ci/ci-coverage-report.js",
  "ci:security": "node scripts/ci/security-quality-check.js",
  "ci:full": "pnpm test:ci && pnpm ci:coverage && pnpm ci:security",
  "ci:comprehensive": "node scripts/ci/comprehensive-test-runner.js"
}
```

## Coverage Thresholds

- **Backend**: 80% minimum coverage
- **Shared Package**: 90% minimum coverage
- **Frontend**: 80% minimum coverage
- **Overall**: 80% minimum coverage

## Security Checks

The CI pipeline now validates:

1. **Dependency Security**
   - Known vulnerability scanning
   - Outdated package detection
   - Security patch requirements

2. **Code Security**
   - Hardcoded secret detection
   - Input validation verification
   - SQL injection protection
   - File permission validation

3. **Quality Standards**
   - Code complexity analysis
   - File size monitoring
   - Naming convention compliance
   - Documentation coverage
   - Error handling assessment

## Reports Generated

1. **Test Reports**
   - `test-report.json` - Individual test results
   - `comprehensive-test-report.json` - Complete test suite results

2. **Coverage Reports**
   - `coverage-report.json` - Detailed coverage analysis
   - HTML coverage reports in `coverage/` directories

3. **Security Reports**
   - Security check results in CI logs
   - Quality assessment metrics
   - Recommendations for improvement

## Running Locally

To run the extended CI checks locally:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run comprehensive test suite
pnpm ci:comprehensive

# Generate coverage report
pnpm ci:coverage

# Run security and quality checks
pnpm ci:security

# Run full CI suite
pnpm ci:full
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

The CI pipeline will:

1. **Fail on Coverage Threshold Violations**
   - Prevents merging if coverage drops below thresholds
   - Provides detailed coverage reports

2. **Alert on Security Issues**
   - Blocks merges with security vulnerabilities
   - Requires security fixes before deployment

3. **Quality Gate Enforcement**
   - Enforces code quality standards
   - Prevents technical debt accumulation

## Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First**
   - Implement tests before new features
   - Maintain high coverage standards

2. **Security First**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets

3. **Quality Maintenance**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Code complexity monitoring
   - Documentation updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Coverage Below Threshold**
   - Add tests for uncovered code paths
   - Review coverage reports for gaps
   - Consider refactoring complex functions

2. **Security Check Failures**
   - Update dependencies with vulnerabilities
   - Remove hardcoded secrets
   - Implement proper input validation

3. **Quality Check Warnings**
   - Reduce file sizes
   - Improve naming conventions
   - Add documentation
   - Enhance error handling

### Getting Help

- Review CI logs for detailed error messages
- Check generated reports for specific issues
- Consult the test files for examples
- Review security and quality check outputs

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing integration
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Response time tracking

2. **Advanced Security**
   - SAST/DAST integration
   - Container security scanning
   - Infrastructure security checks

3. **Quality Metrics**
   - Technical debt tracking
   - Code maintainability scores
   - Architecture compliance checks
