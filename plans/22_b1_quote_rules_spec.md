### **Calculation Details**

#### **Example 1: Web Development**
- Line Total: 40 Ã— $150 = $6,000.00
- Tax: $6,000 Ã— 15% = $900.00
- Final: $6,000 + $900 = $6,900.00

#### **Example 2: Design Services**
- Line Total: 20 Ã— $120 = $2,400.00
- Discount: $2,400 Ã— 10% = $240.00
- Subtotal: $2,400 - $240 = $2,160.00
- Tax: $2,160 Ã— 15% = $324.00
- Final: $2,160 + $324 = $2,484.00

#### **Example 3: Project Management**
- Line Total: 15 Ã— $100 = $1,500.00
- Discount: $1,500 Ã— 5% = $75.00
- Subtotal: $1,500 - $75 = $1,425.00
- Tax: $1,425 Ã— 15% = $213.75
- Final: $1,425 + $213.75 = $1,638.75

#### **Example 4: Content Creation**
- Line Total: 8 Ã— $80 = $640.00
- Tax: $640 Ã— 15% = $96.00
- Final: $640 + $96 = $736.00

#### **Example 5: Travel Expenses**
- Line Total: 100 Ã— $0.85 = $85.00
- Tax: $0.00 (tax exempt)
- Final: $85.00

#### **Example 6: Fixed Discount**
- Line Total: 1 Ã— -$500 = -$500.00
- Tax: $0.00 (negative amount)
- Final: -$500.00

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Notes**

### **Future Considerations**
- **Variable Tax Rates**: Support for different tax rates by service type
- **Tax Exemptions**: Non-profit organizations, government entities
- **Multi-Currency**: Support for international customers
- **Exchange Rates**: Real-time currency conversion
- **Volume Discounts**: Tiered pricing based on project size
- **Customer-Specific Rates**: VIP customer pricing

### **Edge Cases**
- **Zero Amounts**: Handle $0.00 line items correctly
- **Negative Amounts**: Support for credits and adjustments
- **Very Small Amounts**: Ensure precision for fractional cents
- **Large Numbers**: Handle amounts over $1,000,000
- **Rounding Accumulation**: Prevent rounding errors in totals

### **Validation Rules**
- **Positive Quantities**: All quantities must be > 0
- **Valid Rates**: Hourly rates must be reasonable (> $0, < $1000)
- **Discount Limits**: Percentage discounts â‰¤ 100%
- **Tax Compliance**: Ensure tax calculations meet NZ requirements
- **Currency Format**: All amounts in NZD format (0.00)
