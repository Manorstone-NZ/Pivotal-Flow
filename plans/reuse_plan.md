Most of A1 to A7 is app agnostic. Package it once and you can drop it into many product lines with only light customisation. The safest way is to extract the cross cutting parts into a template repo plus a small set of versioned internal packages.

What is reusable right now

• Docker stack for Postgres Redis Prometheus Grafana
• Prisma conventions multi tenant IDs audit fields index patterns
• Auth module JWT plus refresh plus Redis plus RBAC guards
• Repository layer with tenancy guard pagination sorting transactions
• Caching layer Redis get or set single flight jittered TTL plus bust rules
• Observability stack Prometheus metrics Pino structured logs Grafana dashboards and alert rules
• CI quality gates typecheck lint test coverage perf smoke checks and file size limits
• Backup and restore scripts and runbooks
• OpenAPI scaffolding Swagger UI and Postman packs
• Plans and reports as acceptance gates

How to package for future reuse

Create one GitHub Template Repository called pivotalflow app template
Contents
• apps skeleton backend only optional frontend shell
• infra folder with docker compose prometheus grafana and alerts
• prisma folder with baseline schema seed and migrate scripts
• packages shared for repos cache security tenancy logging metrics types
• plans folder with reusable epic templates report templates and go no go checklist
• .github workflows for common CI including db perf smoke and vulnerability scan
• docs folder with ADR template runbooks SLOs and onboarding

Split the runtime bits into private packages so any app can depend on them
• @pivotalflow security password hashing jwt helpers auth types
• @pivotalflow tenancy organisation guard and filters
• @pivotalflow db prisma client wrapper repo base tx helpers pagination sorting
• @pivotalflow cache redis client wrapper single flight ttl jitter and bust helpers
• @pivotalflow metrics prom client registration repo metrics slow query counters
• @pivotalflow logging pino setup request id and enrichers
• @pivotalflow api common zod schemas error mapper openapi helpers

Keep the dashboards and alerts as a small catalogue
• grafana dashboards as json in a dashboards folder
• alert rules as a rules folder included by prometheus.yml

Storage and distribution

• Source of truth the template repo in your org marked as Template so teams can click Use this template
• Packages publish to a private registry for example GitHub Packages with semantic versioning
• Containers push a base backend image with the observability bits pre wired to your private registry
• API and tests keep OpenAPI specs and Postman collections in a shared api folder
• Dashboards keep json in a grafana dashboards repo and import via provisioning
• Cookie cutter optional Python cookiecutter to stamp out a new app name and module identifiers
• Backstage optional scaffolder template if you use Backstage for golden paths

Versioning and governance

• Use semantic release for the internal packages
• One changelog per package and another at the template root
• Deprecation policy write ADRs when changing shared contracts
• Security updates track critical CVEs and have a weekly dependency bump job

How to lift the template into a new app

1 Confirm target app needs auth tenancy audit logging and metrics
2 Click Use this template to create a new repo
3 Run the rename script to set organisation name app code and domains
4 Fill .env from the template example and start Docker
5 Run prisma generate and migrate then seed
6 Run pnpm dev and validate health metrics and swagger
7 Update the logo tokens fonts and icon set only if needed

What you can add to make reuse faster

• A make file or task runner with install validate test seed smoke and perf targets
• A project bootstrap CLI that asks four or five questions then patches names and ports
• A demo data seed pack that shows a full end to end flow
• A Lighthouse CI config and a bundle visualiser report ready to run

Compliance and NZ context

• Keep audit log fields stable for Privacy Act and ISO mapping
• Provide a masking utility for PII in logs
• Add a data residency note in the template docs for NZ hosted options

When to cut the first reusable release

• After A7 when alerts dashboards logs and backups are in place
• Tag v1.0.0 of the template and v1.0.0 of the shared packages
• Record a short adoption guide in docs onboarding

If you want I can turn this into a concrete checklist for converting your current repo into the template plus a minimal package map and the first publish commands.
