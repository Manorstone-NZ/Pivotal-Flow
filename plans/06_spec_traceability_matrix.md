# Pivotal Flow - Specification Traceability Matrix

## üéØ **Traceability Overview**

### **Purpose**
This matrix ensures every requirement from the specification documents is mapped to specific code modules, test coverage, and deliverables, providing complete traceability from requirements to implementation.

### **Matrix Structure**
- **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier for each requirement
- **Spec Source**: Source document and section reference
- **Module/Component**: Code artefact that implements the requirement
- **Test Coverage**: Testing approach and coverage targets
- **Status**: Implementation and testing status
