# Pivotal Flow - Integration Workflows & External Connections

## 🎯 **Integration Overview - How the System Connects with the Real World**

### **Why This Matters**
Understanding **integrations** is crucial because it shows:
- **How users work** with their existing tools and workflows
- **What data flows** between different systems automatically
- **How the system fits** into daily business operations
- **What manual work** gets automated
- **How users get value** from connected systems

### **The Integration Ecosystem**
```
Pivotal Flow ↔ Email Systems ↔ Payment Gateways ↔ File Storage ↔ Accounting ↔ CRM ↔ Communication
```
