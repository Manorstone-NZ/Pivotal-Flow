# Pivotal Flow - Data Processing & Business Intelligence

## 🎯 **Data Processing Overview - How Information Flows Through the System**

### **Why This Matters**
Understanding **data processing** is crucial because it shows:
- **How information moves** from input to insight
- **What calculations happen** automatically
- **How users get actionable intelligence** from raw data
- **What business decisions** the system enables
- **How data quality** affects business outcomes

### **The Data Processing Pipeline**
```
Raw Data → Validation → Processing → Calculation → Analysis → Insight → Action
```

├── Project: Website Redesign (PRJ-2025-001)
├── Task: Frontend Development
├── Date: 2025-01-20
├── Start Time: 9:00 AM
├── End Time: 5:00 PM
├── Break Time: 1 hour
├── Description: Built responsive navigation and hero section
└── Billable: Yes
```

#### **Data Processing Steps:**
```
Step 1: Time Validation
├── Check start time < end time
├── Verify duration ≤ 12 hours
├── Check for overlapping entries
├── Validate project is active
├── Confirm task is assigned to user
└── Verify break time is reasonable

Step 2: Duration Calculation
├── Calculate total duration: 5:00 PM - 9:00 AM = 8 hours
├── Subtract break time: 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours
├── Convert to decimal: 7.0 hours
├── Validate against daily limit: 7.0 ≤ 12 ✓
└── Check weekly total: Previous + 7.0 ≤ 40 ✓

Step 3: Cost Calculation
├── Get user hourly rate: $150/hour
├── Calculate billable hours: 7.0 hours
├── Calculate total cost: 7.0 × $150 = $1,050
├── Apply project markup: $1,050 × 1.3 = $1,365
└── Update project actual cost

Step 4: Budget Tracking
├── Get project budget: $20,000
├── Get current actual cost: $14,225 + $1,365 = $15,590
├── Calculate remaining budget: $20,000 - $15,590 = $4,410
├── Calculate budget used: (15,590 / 20,000) × 100 = 77.95%
└── Check for budget alerts
```

#### **Output Data:**
```
Time Entry Processed:
├── Duration: 7.0 hours
├── Billable Hours: 7.0 hours
├── Hourly Rate: $150
├── Total Cost: $1,050
├── Project Cost: $1,365 (with markup)
├── Budget Used: 77.95%
├── Status: Pending Approval
└── Created: 2025-01-20 17:00
```

#### **Business Rules Applied:**
1. **Time Validation**: No overlapping entries, reasonable duration
2. **Rate Application**: User-specific hourly rate
3. **Markup Calculation**: 30% markup for project profitability
4. **Budget Tracking**: Real-time budget vs. actual monitoring
5. **Approval Workflow**: Entries > 2 hours need approval
